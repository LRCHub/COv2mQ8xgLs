Moon river,
Wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style
Some day
Oh, dream maker,
You heart breaker
Wherever you're goin',
I'm goin' your way

Two drifters,
Off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
And We're after the same rainbow's end,
Ah-waitin' round the bend
My huckleberry friend,
Moon river,
And me.

We're after the same rainbow's end,
Ah-waitin' round the bend,
My huckleberry friend,
Moon river,
And me.

Mmmmm.
(Oh... Moon river)
